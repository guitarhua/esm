Efficient State Machine framework
=================================

Introduction
------------
This repository gathers all the ideas and implementation tricks I had around lightweight, efficient
statecharts implementation in C. Inspired by [QP framework](https://state-machine.com/doc/concepts).
Provided are three examples: simple blink state machine transitioning between two states,
classic dining philosophers problem and cigarette smokers problem.


TODO
----

 - adding hierarchical state machine support
 - add proper platform (BSP) separation
 - change to more flexible build system
